Hi my name is Cemal (Je-mal), I am a Junior full stack developer at [`Yalla Coop`](https://github.com/yalla-coop/)

Once upon a time I worked in the design industry, designing furniture and products. 

Lately, I've been learning how to solve problems with lines of code instead of pieces of wood. 

I graduated from the `Founders and Coders` bootcamp in 2021 and started at Yalla Coop as an Apprentice soon after; I have recently graduated from the Level 4 Software Developer apprenticeship with a grade of distinction.

In my free time I like to climb üßóüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, take photographs üì∑ and make things üî®.
