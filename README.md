I’m Cemal (Je-mal), I live in South London 💂. I am an ex-furniture designer now with big plans to become a Web Developer. I have a basic understanding of Javascript, HTML and CSS and learn something new everyday!

I have completed the [**University of Helsinki Java Mooc Part 1**](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/) and am currently working through the Full Stack Open program too.

In my free time I like to go climbing 🧗🏼‍♂️ and walking, to read 📚, watch crime dramas 📺 and watch films 🎞️.
